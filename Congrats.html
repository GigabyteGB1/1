<br/>
<b>I'm back, sorry for no updates!</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Just for everyone's concern, this program makes it EASIER to make script mods for GTA V. <br/>
It will not do everything for you, You will need to have some knowledge of C# to create a mod.<br/>
For those who are complete noobs when it comes to making these mods, learn some of the scripting language first,<br />
that way you know how everything is laid out, and how to properly declare variables and functions. I personally will <br/>
help you if you contact me via steam: fifsa , just know, I do not answer right away, I am very busy & <br/>
dont always have a lot of time on my hands to be throwing code between messages. I thank you all for using this program, and have a nice day.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>What's new, </b><i>v2</i>:
Brand new, here's what version 2 has to offer:<br/>
More functions, all with easier UI help.<br/>
Much more easy and friendly UI system.<br/>
Updated syntax highlighting to highlight all C# and the GTA script language.<br/>
Fixed every bug you could think of.<br/>
Rewritten in C# (was in VB before)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Future</b> for v2...<br/>
I will definitely be adding live chat in the next update. I was gonna do it now but decided to wait a little<br/>
Colors on the interface - right now its just plain gray,white,black,etc.<br/>
